# ros-learning-code
Some demo code (organized as Catkin packages) for ROS Kinetic.

# Development Platform
The development is based on RIA-E100 model from Gaitech Edu.

# How to use?
Each folder in this repository is a catkin package folder, which should be placed under `src` of your catkin workspace, e.g. `~/catkin_ws/src`. Use `catkin_make` to compile them, and run them with ROS utilities.

# Contents
- my_motion_test - code related to motion of a robot (move on the ground)
- my_imu_test - related to imu and simple odom navigation.

May have more things later...
